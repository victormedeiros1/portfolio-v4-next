  about_me_paragraph2:
    'When I got to know the front-end and saw the infinite sea of possibilities, I fell in love, I always liked the visual and creative side of things, so I started to interact with the community, working as a team, meeting and exchanging knowledge with new people. essential.',
  about_me_paragraph3:

  works_netflix_paragraph2:
    "Hox.rs was responsible for implementing a shorter “virtual version” of Almanac Tudum. Through Figma we had access to the project screens and started development. I worked as a front-end developer creating the code for most of the site's pages.",
  works_netflix_paragraph3:
    "As it was my first time working in a company, I couldn't believe the moment I saw who the project was for. When I entered Figma and saw that someone from Netflix was working there “on my side”, the feeling was of euphoria.",
  works_netflix_paragraph4:
    'Working together with a team of developers, learning from them and creating something for such a big name was wonderful.',
  works_netflix_paragraph5:
    "Of all the projects I've participated so far, this is without a doubt the one I love the most, because it was where it all started and where I was sure it was in this world that I wanted to work.",

  works_spotify_paragraph1:
    'A project to celebrate the content creators who managed to reach the Top 10 Podcasts in Brazil.',
  works_spotify_paragraph2:
    'I participated in two stages in this project, first in the development of the page where I built much of the body of the site, we accessed the data from an endpoint and made the listing showing its information.',
  works_spotify_paragraph3:
    "The second stage was more interesting and challenging, I had never worked with email marketing and it seemed to me to be something very simple, until I discovered the limitations at the code level, for example, the structure of the email had to be made only with tables, the css all inline , some css attributes and html tags didn't work, the images would have to be placed in the cloud for display and several other limitations that I discovered over time.",
  works_spotify_paragraph4:
    'Studying further I found that each email service can interpret its code in a different way, a css attribute could work in Gmail but not in Outlook. So it was necessary to do several tests.',
  works_spotify_paragraph5:
    'Again I was shocked to learn that the project was for none other than Spotify and even more shocked when I went to implement the emails and realized that they would be sent to podcasts that I listened to daily, to the biggest in the country. It was a mixture of endless happiness and fear, there was a big responsibility there, I never did so many tests in my life until I was sure that everything was perfect hahahaha.',

  works_omega_paragraph2:
    'The idea of this application was a “fullpage” style website, there is no scrolling, only a menu where you can navigate between the sections of the page and view the information. It was my first time doing a site in this style, but I did well and I really liked it.    ',
  works_omega_paragraph3:
    "The second stage was more interesting and challenging, I had never worked with email marketing and it seemed to me to be something very simple, until I discovered the limitations at the code level, for example, the structure of the email had to be made only with tables, the css all inline , some css attributes and html tags didn't work, the images would have to be placed in the cloud for display and several other limitations that I discovered over time.",
